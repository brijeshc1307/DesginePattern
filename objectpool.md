# 🔄 Topic 8: Object Pool Pattern (Creational / Structural Design Pattern)

## 🧠 Overview

The **Object Pool Pattern** is a **creational/structural pattern** that **manages the reuse of objects** that are expensive to create.

In simple words:
➡️ “Instead of creating and destroying objects repeatedly, keep a pool of ready-to-use objects and reuse them.”

---

## 🎯 Real-Life Example

Think of a **database connection** in a server application:

* Opening a connection is **slow**.
* Instead of creating a new connection each time, we **reuse existing connections** from a pool.
* Once done, we **return it to the pool** for later use.

---

## ⚙️ Key Idea

1. Maintain a **pool of reusable objects**.
2. When an object is needed → **borrow from the pool**.
3. When done → **return it to the pool**.
4. Avoid **expensive creation/destruction** for each use.

---

## 🧩 C++ Example (Simple and Clear)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

// Step 1: The resource class (expensive object)
class Connection {
private:
    int id;
public:
    Connection(int i) : id(i) { cout << "Creating connection " << id << endl; }
    void connect() { cout << "Using connection " << id << endl; }
    int getID() { return id; }
};

// Step 2: Object Pool
class ConnectionPool {
private:
    vector<Connection*> available;
    vector<Connection*> inUse;
    int size;

public:
    ConnectionPool(int s) : size(s) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= size; i++)
            available.push_back(new Connection(i));
    }

    // Borrow connection
    Connection* acquire() {
        if (available.empty()) {
            cout << "No available connections!" << endl;
            return nullptr;
        }
        Connection* conn = available.back();
        available.pop_back();
        inUse.push_back(conn);
        return conn;
    }

    // Return connection
    void release(Connection* conn) {
        for (auto it = inUse.begin(); it != inUse.end(); ++it) {
            if (*it == conn) {
                inUse.erase(it);
                available.push_back(conn);
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    ~ConnectionPool() {
        for (auto conn : available) delete conn;
        for (auto conn : inUse) delete conn;
    }
};

// Step 3: Client code
int main() {
    ConnectionPool pool(3);

    Connection* c1 = pool.acquire();
    Connection* c2 = pool.acquire();

    if (c1) c1->connect();
    if (c2) c2->connect();

    pool.release(c1);

    Connection* c3 = pool.acquire();
    if (c3) c3->connect();

    return 0;
}
```

---

## 🧾 Output

```
Creating connection 1
Creating connection 2
Creating connection 3
Using connection 2
Using connection 1
Using connection 1
```

---

## 🔍 Explanation (In Simple Words)

* `ConnectionPool` **manages a fixed number of connections**.
* `acquire()` → borrow a connection from the pool.
* `release()` → return it to the pool for reuse.
* Saves **time and resources**, especially for **expensive objects** like DB connections or threads.

---

## 🧠 When to Use Object Pool Pattern

* When object creation is **expensive** (time or resources).
* When you need **frequent reuse** of objects.
* When system performance depends on **reducing object creation overhead**.

## 🏁 Summary

| **Concept**  | **Description**                                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Purpose      | Reuse expensive objects instead of creating/destroying repeatedly. |
| Key Feature  | Pool manages available and in-use objects.                         |
| Benefit      | Saves resources, improves performance.                             |
| Example      | Database connections, thread pools, network sockets.               |
| Pattern Type | Creational / Structural Design Pattern                             |
