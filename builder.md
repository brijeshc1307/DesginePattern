Perfect, Brijesh! 👏
You’re progressing excellently through the **Creational Design Patterns** series.
Let’s now move on to the next one — the **Builder Pattern**, explained in **simple English** with **clear C++ code** examples.

# 🧱 Topic 6: Builder Pattern (Creational Design Pattern)

## 🧠 Overview

The **Builder Pattern** helps you **create complex objects step by step**.

Instead of writing a big constructor with too many parameters (which can be confusing),
the Builder Pattern separates **object construction** from **object representation** — so the same construction process can create **different representations**.

---

## 🎯 Real-Life Example

Imagine you’re ordering a **burger meal** at a restaurant 🍔🍟🥤.
You can choose what to include — bun type, patty, cheese, drink, etc.
The chef (builder) prepares your customized meal step by step.

Similarly, in C++, the Builder Pattern helps you **build complex objects** (like a Car, PC, or Report) in small, manageable steps.

---

## ⚙️ Key Idea

1. A **Builder** constructs complex objects step by step.
2. A **Director** controls the building process.
3. The **final product** is assembled by combining these steps.

---

## 🧩 C++ Example (Simple and Easy)

Let’s build a **Car** object with parts like engine, seats, and GPS.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Step 1: The Product class
class Car {
public:
    string engine;
    string seats;
    string GPS;

    void showCar() {
        cout << "Car built with: " << engine << ", " << seats << ", " << GPS << endl;
    }
};

// Step 2: The Builder interface
class CarBuilder {
public:
    virtual void buildEngine() = 0;
    virtual void buildSeats() = 0;
    virtual void buildGPS() = 0;
    virtual Car* getCar() = 0;
};

// Step 3: Concrete Builders
class SportsCarBuilder : public CarBuilder {
private:
    Car* car;
public:
    SportsCarBuilder() { car = new Car(); }

    void buildEngine() override { car->engine = "V8 Engine"; }
    void buildSeats() override { car->seats = "2 Leather Seats"; }
    void buildGPS() override { car->GPS = "Advanced GPS System"; }

    Car* getCar() override { return car; }
};

class SUVCarBuilder : public CarBuilder {
private:
    Car* car;
public:
    SUVCarBuilder() { car = new Car(); }

    void buildEngine() override { car->engine = "V6 Engine"; }
    void buildSeats() override { car->seats = "7 Comfortable Seats"; }
    void buildGPS() override { car->GPS = "Basic GPS"; }

    Car* getCar() override { return car; }
};

// Step 4: Director class — controls the building steps
class Director {
public:
    void construct(CarBuilder* builder) {
        builder->buildEngine();
        builder->buildSeats();
        builder->buildGPS();
    }
};

// Step 5: Client code
int main() {
    Director director;

    SportsCarBuilder sportsBuilder;
    SUVCarBuilder suvBuilder;

    director.construct(&sportsBuilder);
    Car* sportsCar = sportsBuilder.getCar();
    sportsCar->showCar();

    director.construct(&suvBuilder);
    Car* suvCar = suvBuilder.getCar();
    suvCar->showCar();

    delete sportsCar;
    delete suvCar;

    return 0;
}
```

## 🧾 Output

```
Car built with: V8 Engine, 2 Leather Seats, Advanced GPS System
Car built with: V6 Engine, 7 Comfortable Seats, Basic GPS
```

---

## 🔍 Explanation (In Simple Words)

* **Car** → The final product we’re building.
* **CarBuilder** → The abstract blueprint (defines the building steps).
* **SportsCarBuilder** and **SUVCarBuilder** → Different ways to build cars.
* **Director** → Organizes the construction steps in the correct order.
* **main()** → Client just tells the director what type of car to build.

This way, we can **easily create different types of objects** (like sports or SUV cars) without rewriting the construction logic.

---

## 🧠 When to Use Builder Pattern

* When object creation involves **many steps or configurations**.
* When constructors with too many parameters become confusing.
* When you need **different representations** of the same object.

✅ **Quick Comparison with Factory Patterns**

| Pattern          | Focus                               | Example              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Factory Method   | Creates one object                  | Car or Bike          |
| Abstract Factory | Creates families of related objects | Windows UI or Mac UI |
| Builder          | Creates complex object step by step | SportsCar or SUVCar  |
